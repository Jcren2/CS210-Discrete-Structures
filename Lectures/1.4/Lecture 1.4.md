# Predicates

## Definitions

### Predicate

> In mathematics, a predicate is commonly understood to be a Boolean-valued function P: X→ {true, false}, called the predicate on X.

> Informally, a predicate is a statement that may be true or false depending on the values of its variables.[1] It can be thought of as an operator or function that returns a value that is either true or false.[2]

### Domain

asdf

### Symbols

* ∈ = Is an element of
* ∃ = There exists
* ∀ = For all

### Counterexample

> In logic, and especially in its applications to mathematics and philosophy, a counterexample is an exception to a proposed general rule or law.

> More precisely, a counterexample is a specific instance of the falsity of a universal quantification (a "for all" statement).

([Counterexample / Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterexample))

### Set

> A set is a well defined collection of distinct objects.

> Sets are conventionally denoted with capital letters. Sets A and B are equal if and only if they have precisely the same elements.

> An extensional definition is denoted by enclosing the list of members in curly brackets:

>    C = {4, 2, 1, 3}

>    D = {blue, white, red}.

### Negations

We can apply DeMorgan's laws towards predicates as well as propositions.

* Propositions
	* ¬( A ∧ B ) ≡ ( ¬A ∨ ¬B )
	* ¬( A ∨ B ) ≡ ( ¬A ∧ ¬B )
	
* Predicates
	* The negation of **∀ x ∈ X, P(x)** is **∃ x ∈ X, ¬P(x)**
		* ([Universal quantification / Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_quantification#Negation))
	* The negation of **∃ x ∈ X, P(x)** is **∀ x ∈ X, ¬P(x)**
		* ([Existential quantification / Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_quantification#Negation))
