# Implications

## Definitions

### Implication

An Implication is when we write an "if, else" statement in Discrete Math, such as
"if p is true, then q is true".

We can write implications for both propositions and for predicates.

### Implies

We use the arrow operator ➝ to symbolize "implies". 

So for "if p is true, then q is true", we would write **p ➝ q**.

### Hypothesis

For the statement **p ➝ q**, p is the hypothesis.

### Conclusion

For the statement **p ➝ q**, q is the conclusion.

In order to prove an implication to be false, we must have a case where
the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false.
